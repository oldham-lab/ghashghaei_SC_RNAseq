###############################################################

1) Directories: contain the gzipped fastq files and SampleSheet.csv files from each sequencing run performed. The directory name is the sequeuncing run ID.
2) *.fastq.gz: demultiplexed fastq files for each sample sequenced in run. The sample name is the first portion of the fastq file name.
3) SampleSheet.csv: file used to demultiplex bcl files into fastq files. (Demultiplexing has already been performed, SampleSheet.csv files may still contain important metadta.)
4) SequencingRunID.md5sum: contains hash IDs for each fastq file. Can you used to validate that no files were corrupted in the transfer process.
